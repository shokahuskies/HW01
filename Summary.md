# SUMMARY TEMPLATE
Answer all the questions. Please put your answers *after* the italicized instructions.

## Scoring System Rationale  
*Explain how you decided on the point values for each criterion in your `HousingPriorityCalculator` class. Why these weights? How do they reflect the goals of fairness, simplicity, or rewarding effort? Be specific about your point values for:*
- *Class year (1=Freshman, 2=Sophomore, 3=Junior, 4=Senior) - how many points each?*
- *Graduation status (True/False) - how many points?*  
- *Credits earned - points per credit or brackets?*
- *Additional questions - what questions did you choose and how many points each?*

*Also include your complete scoring breakdown here so TAs can verify your test calculations.*

[10 points]  
*Answer: 
Class Year: 
I have decided to use the linear point system (Freshman = 10, Sophmore = 20, Junior = 30, Senior = 40) for my point system because of how I thought it would be easier to accumulate the points. 
Gradutation Status: 
I have decided to go with the traditional approach, where if they DID graduate, they would be earning 5 points, and if they DIDN'T, they would get just 0 points
Credits Earned:
I wanted to make the system similar to the system we have at Northeastern, so i dedicded to implement a system where I would be adding 1 point per credit hour. 
I thought that it would be best to go with the 
Additional Questions:
I have decided to ask two additional questions 
1. one would be about if they are a honor student 
2. if they would be recieving aid

i decided on these two questions since i belive that if they are a honor student, the school should try their best to support that student's academical capabilities through helping them secure a housing that is comfortable for them. I belive that they should also recieve more points if they are recieving aid since the housing can help them save money and help them through their financial situations borth of these additional questions would be reiving five points if answered yes *

### Who did you work with and how?   
*Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you don't share code.*   
*Please include any people or other sources who helped you, and any students whom you helped.*   
*For each source, make sure to include how they helped you (or how you helped them).*

* *"I was confused on how to implement on some of the tests where you are suppose to return an output for only the valid inputs, and the tests in the file of impl files. Taotao Li from my same lecture class was able to guide me through these testing questions by giving me hints on how to solve them . "*   
* *"I showed Bob Lee my test-mocking approach for calculate_score; he gave me feedback on ordering the decorators."*

## Logistics 

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?   
*Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass. Be specific about any methods or test cases that are incomplete.*    

[1 point]   
*Answer:*  
I was able to implement the things that was requested, but I am not sure if I did them correctly because of how I kept on running into a src error where my file wasn't able to read a different file. Therefore, I wasn't able to test my code that much, which makes me nervous that my implementation isn't correct. However, I really tried my best through looking through past lecture notes and my the lectures. 

### How long did the assignment take?   
*Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range. Break down time spent on different parts (writing tests, implementation, debugging, documentation).*

*Answer: Writing the test down took a bit because there were a lot and i was tryuing to figure about what to do for the tests. However, when iI digured it out I think it took me about an hour to two hours to write down all the tests along with some bugs. For the actual implenetation, it took me about the same because I was trying to figure out how to make sure that the tests were decent. However, the debugging is takeing me a while because of how I am not sure how to figure out the src error. I believe it came from me not being able to push the code onto github. In total, I think the assingment took aroudn three hours to three hours and a half.*

## Reflections   
*Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the assignment, including answers to all of these questions:*   
* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?   
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?   
* What did you learn from this assignment?
* Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and lecture are always welcome.

*Answer: I think the most difficult part of this assingment was learning how to write the different tests, and embedding the different structures into my code. Although I personally had coding experience, I haven't really incoporated strucutre into them like OOP, so some of the formatting confused me a little but I think it was still rewarding when I learned how to initailzie each variblae, and how to make my code seem a lot more cleaner. I think the rewarding part of the assingment was seeing my coding improve through having a much more organized and strucutred code since although the coding expeirnce that I previously had may reflect the amount of coding I have known, it was a little difficult for me when I had to debug them since they lacked strucutre and therefore were harder for me to read. Seeing a furnished code made me realized how much skill I have earned despite how early it is in the class, and made my understanding in computer science more deeper. 

From this assingment, I have learned how to write tests in python and how to mock user inputs when I am writing such tests. I believe that through learning this skill, I will be able to learn how to make my future projects more accurate through learning how to make such tests cases and also having a concised testing protocal. I have also learned about Object Oriented Programming in this section of the homework, which will allow me to make a code that can be utilzied in different many ways through a simple form. Personally, because I did not have much time to work on the code for this assingment, I personally do not think that the implementation of the code is good or as good as it could have been. Therefore, I think starting next assingment I should start it easier and visit office hours more often because I didn't think the office hours would be online, but I thought that it would be inperson so it would be much easier and faster for me to debug. I also think that I will try to do more research beyond just the given lesson plans that our professor has given us since I feel like i needed more different examples of how to write my planned implementation, but I wasn't sure where to visit for more examples of codes that followed a similar strucutre as ours. *
