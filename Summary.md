# SUMMARY TEMPLATE
Answer all the questions. Please put your answers *after* the italicized instructions.

## Scoring System Rationale  
*Explain how you decided on the point values for each criterion in your `HousingPriorityCalculator` class. Why these weights? How do they reflect the goals of fairness, simplicity, or rewarding effort? Be specific about your point values for:*
- *Class year (1=Freshman, 2=Sophomore, 3=Junior, 4=Senior) - how many points each?*
- *Graduation status (True/False) - how many points?*  
- *Credits earned - points per credit or brackets?*
- *Additional questions - what questions did you choose and how many points each?*

*Also include your complete scoring breakdown here so TAs can verify your test calculations.*

### How long did the assignment take?
