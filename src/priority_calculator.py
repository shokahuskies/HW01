HW 1: Housing Priority Calculator - Priority Calculator Module

This module contains the HousingPriorityCalculator class 
responsible for calculating priority scores.

Implement each method as described in the handout.

    def points_for_class_year(self, year: int) -> int:
        """
        Given an integer `year`, return points based on your scoring system.

        Here, you may assume year is an integer from 1 to 4, since we already 
        validated input in the question asker. 

        Example scoring systems:
        - Linear: Freshman=1, Sophomore=2, Junior=3, Senior=4
        - Exponential: Freshman=2, Sophomore=4, Junior=8, Senior=16
        - Custom: Design your own fair system

        Document your chosen system in SUMMARY.md!

        Typical approach: graduating students get bonus points (e.g., 5),
        non-graduating students get 0. But you can design your own system.

        Example systems:
        - 1 point per credit
        - 0.5 points per credit
        - Tiered system: 0-30 credits = 1pt each, 31+ = 2pts each
        - Maximum cap: up to 50 credits count

        Here, you may assume num_credits is a non-negative integer,
