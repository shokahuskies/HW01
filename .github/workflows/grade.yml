# This workflow is used to submit a student's code to Pawtograder and run the grader on it
# See https://github.com/pawtograder/assignment-action for more on how this works

# To the intrepid student: You must not edit this file. Tampering with this file could 
# reveal the instructor's solution to you. Hence, Pawtograder will automatically compare
# the hash of this file (when the submission is being created) to the hash of the file 
# provided in your handout. In addition to failing to register a submission (and not
# providing the workflow with access to the instructor's solution), your instructors will
# be notified of this security violation.
